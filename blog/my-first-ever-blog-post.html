I guess I&#39;ve always assumed that noone would care what I had to say, which I still do but whatever. New year, new site, new blog.
<!-- more --></p>
<p>I decided to go with Harp to power my new site, and with a travel blog in the making, I figured I might as well evaluate blogging with it on my personal site.</p>
<h2>What I like about Harp</h2>
<p>I like the way that Harp mostly just works, that I can work with .less files without having to write <em>another</em> grunt file, and that it&#39;s mostly intuitive. Hopefully this will keep me (and my short attention span) happy enough to continue updating it.</p>
<p>Oh, and a static site is cheap to host (as a Yorkshireman, I should have put this as the main point...).</p>
<h2>What I don&#39;t like</h2>
<p>I don&#39;t like having to write a .json file for metadata, I don&#39;t like that I can&#39;t easily create categories, and I don&#39;t like that I can&#39;t paginate my blog and have to have a huge list of posts (when I have a huge amount anyway) rather than next and previous links.</p>
<p>These are small pain points, but I would have preferred to be able to use YAML front-matter for my metadata in the same way you can with Jekyll. I know there are performance issues with doing so, but I&#39;d still prefer it. And let&#39;s face it, the whole point is to compile into a static site anyway, I wouldn&#39;t be running <code>harp server</code> in production.</p>
<p>The pagination and categorisation issues are probably solvable in some way, I&#39;ll have to dig into the source to take a look, or maybe I&#39;ll just fork harp and put in some plugin architecture for my own use.</p>
<p>For now, it&#39;s easier than having to write my own static site generator, and for my requirements a whole lot better than writing a database powered blog. Maybe for the travel site I&#39;ll use something else, but let&#39;s see how this plays out first.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you like the site, I feel it&#39;s very boring, but having redesigned my personal site about 50 million times in the last few years, at least it&#39;s in the wild!</p>
<p>Until the next time...</p>
