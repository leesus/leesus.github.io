    h2 Profile
    p I am a front-end developer &amp; designer with over 8 years of experience. I specialise in modern responsive HTML, CSS &amp; Javascript builds, with a focus on usability and accessibility.  I have experience of libraries and frameworks including jQuery, Knockout.js, Angular.js and LESS. I have a formal background in design and create wireframes and design mockups using Photoshop &amp; Illustrator. I am comfortable with backend work in C# ASP.NET; this helps me integrate easily into team-based development where tasks and skills are distributed.  I am hardworking, enthusiastic and show a good deal of attention to detail and possess excellent time keeping and project management skills. I strive to learn new skills and further develop the skills I have in order to stay ahead of web &amp; IT technologies and feel I would be a worthy member of any team.
